## About Me

I am a PhD student at Rice Bioengineering program, co-advised by Dr. Bashor and Dr. Igoshin. Prior to this, I had my bachelor's degree at UW-Madison, majoring in biochemistry and computer sciences.

## My Research Interests

I am interested in applying machine learning to solve biology problems. Particularly, I am interested in using ML models to gain insights to improve our understanding of biological systems, as well as using it to guide synthetic gene circuit design.

My current project focus on leaveraging transfer learning to study prokaryotic gene regulatory elements (GREs), in particular, the ribosome binding site (RBS) sequence. We demonstrated that by utilizing a predictive model trained on a large dataset collected in *E. coli*, we were able to fine-tune the model to predict the RBS strength in other non-model species with a small, easy to collect dataset. Additionally, analyzing the prediction of the model allows us to discover the tetra-start codon effect
