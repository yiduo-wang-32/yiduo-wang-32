Particularly, I am interested in using ML models to gain insights to improve our understanding of biological systems, as well as using them to guide synthetic gene circuit design.</p> <p>My current project focuses on leveraging transfer learning to study prokaryotic gene regulatory elements (GREs), in particular, the ribosome binding site (RBS) sequence. We demonstrated that by utilizing a predictive model trained on a large dataset collected in E. coli, we were able to fine-tune the model to predict the RBS strength in other non-model species with a small, easy-to-collect dataset. Additionally, analyzing the prediction of the model allows us to discover the tetra-start codon effect</p>"},{"location":"#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>Rai, K., Wang, Y., O\u2019Connell, R.
